   In order to remove any string errors, I used htmlspecialchars(), stripslashes(), trim(). preg_match(), FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL, FILTER_VALIDATE_INT,in_array().

2. In your own words, why is it important to add validation to the forms?
   For the aspect of data accuracy, it helps prevent errors. User input can cause any type of error such as missing or incorrect information, formatting issues. It could be a huge mistake and malfunction in a website.
